# Jobstreet Data Engineering Project
## Introduction
In this project, I developed an end-to-end data pipeline to process and load data from a dataset containing job listings scraped from Jobstreet. The core objectives for the project are as follow:
* Extract job listing data from Jobstreet dataset.
* Clean and transform the data as needed (e.g. handle missing values, convert data types).
* Load the data into Google Cloud Storage for further processing.
* Save the data into BigQuery and organize it using the Star Schema modeling approach.
* Orchestrate the data pipeline.
* Visualize the data by creating a dashboard which connects to the database in BigQuery.

The following sections will elaborate upon the details on the tools and processes involved to create this pipeline.
